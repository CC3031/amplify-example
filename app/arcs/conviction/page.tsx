            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>
                The Conviction arc takes place after the events of the Black Swordsman 
                arc and bridges the series from Guts' lone vengeful path towards the 
                ragtag group that will travel with him — it introduces new antagonists and 
                future allies.

            <h3>Brief Summary</h3>
            <p>
                This arc covers Guts' hunt for more apostles. His brutality is really shown 
                towards the beginning, where he mercilessly cuts down hostile creatures that 
                were formerly children. Afterwards, Casca goes missing and Guts hurriedly 
                goes to find her. It's also where Farnese, Serpico, and later Isidro first 
                cross paths with Guts and begin their journeys.

            <h3>Comments</h3>
            <p>
                Conviction is grim and relentless, heavy on religious horror and moral 
                ambiguity, but it's crucial for paving the path for the evolution of Guts' 
                character from a lone crusader to a determined leader.
