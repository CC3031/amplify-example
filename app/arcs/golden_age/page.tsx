            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>
                The Golden Age arc is the foundational backstory for Berserk — it follows 
                Guts from his brutal childhood into his time with Griffith and the Band of 
                the Hawk, and ends with the catastrophic Eclipse that reshapes the series.

            <h3>Brief Summary</h3>
            <p>
                We see Guts' origin, his recruitment by Griffith, the Band's rise across the 
                battlefield, Griffith's ambition and eventual fall from grace. The arc 
                culminates in the Eclipse: betrayal, sacrifice, and the events that turn 
                Guts into the Black Swordsman.

            <h3>Comments</h3>
            <p>
                Widely regarded as the most emotional arc of Berserk, the Golden Age blends 
                epic war drama with intimate character development. It is the single most 
                important arc for understanding why everything matters. It isn't regarded as 
                the best arc for nothing. This mf made me tear up.
