            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>
                Fantasia follows Falcon of the Millennium and depicts the world after the 
                boundary between the physical and astral realms collapses — the series moves 
                into a surreal, apocalyptic phase with reality transformed.

            <h3>Brief Summary</h3>
            <p>
                The Fabric of the world changes: spirits, elves, and monsters become visible; 
                ordinary life and magic collide; and Guts must protect his party as  
                Griffith's empire reaches full power. The arc mixes small, personal scenes 
                with truly world-ending consequences.

            <h3>Comments</h3>
            <p>
                In terms of global effect, Fantasia is the most significant. Now, not only 
                is it Guts' party living his nightmare, but the entire world is forced to 
                host these thought-to-be mythical creatures. As it's currently ongoing, it 
                drives Berserk in a very interesting and unseen direction.
