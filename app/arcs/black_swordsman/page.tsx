            <p>
                The Black Swordsman arc chronologically takes place after the eclipse in
                the Golden Age but before the Conviction arc.

            <h3>Brief Summary</h3>
            <p>
                It infamously starts with the panel of Guts 'letting off some steam' before
                blowing the brains off an apostle. Ultimately, it spans Gut's hunt for the 
                snake baron, a particularly strong apostle.

            <h3>Comments</h3>
            <p>
               Due to Kentaro Miura not quite knowing the direction Berserk would take while 
               writing this, there are some pretty twisted things in this arc. It has an edge 
               that a lot of the others arcs don't. However, Guts' more cynical attitude in 
               this arc is perfectly explained by the greatest flashback in history (the 
               Golden Age). It definitely does do its job of hooking the audience in, though.
