            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>
                The Falcon of the Millennium arc (often called Falcon of the Millennium 
                Empire) runs after Conviction and follows Griffith's rebirth and rise as a 
                political and military power.

            <h3>Brief Summary</h3>
            <p>
                Griffith reappears, reforms the Band of the Hawk, and builds a new kingdom. 
                The arc spans diplomatic maneuvering, full-scale wars, sieges, and the 
                shifting balance between human politics and supernatural influence, which 
                inevitably sets the stage for Guts and Griffith to meet again.

            <h3>Comments</h3>
            <p>
                This arc puts more of a focus on Griffith's rise rather than following Guts'
                party. It is essentially what would happen if God tried their hand at 
                becoming a billionaire. Sure, he could do it instantly, but what's the fun 
                in that?
